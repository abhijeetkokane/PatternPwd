The Android unlock pattern has the following constraints:

    it must use between four and nine dots;
    a dot can only be used once;
    a dot cannot be crossed unless it has already been used; and
    a line between dots can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal.

Good Android lock patterns are complex. For example, a simple pattern such as an L-shape has the same weaknesses as an easily guessable password. 
I recommend creating a lock pattern that is non-linear and also crosses back on itself at least twice to create multiple possible endpoints. 
This is important because one of swiping's weaknesses is the smudge trail it leaves on the screen. 
If somebody picks up a phone, they can retrace the user's pattern by following the smudge trail. 
If the pattern has multiple endpoints, then the start and finish points of the trail will be less obvious.
